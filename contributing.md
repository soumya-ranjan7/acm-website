### Guidelines:

+ *Don't directly push you code*
+ First fork the project 
+ Make Pull Request referring to the issue it refer to
+ First get all relevant details of the issue before working on it.
+ Properly document your code and put all styles in proper file as all css files are separate
+ Design should be checked in mobile first and then in laptop
+ Good Luck! Happy Coding.. :smiley:
